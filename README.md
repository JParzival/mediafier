Python library that helps with media (image/video) transformation and augmentation for machine learning and artificial vision projects. Enables the user to modify media for different purposes, as increasing a dataset or just changing some properties.

This library is different to many others in the way that wants to **make image and video transformation simple** by one liners, but fully customisable at the same time. Media transformation for everyone.
