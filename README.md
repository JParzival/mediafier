🔧 LIBRARY UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🔧

Python library that helps with media (image/video) transformation and augmentation for machine learning and artificial vision projects. Enables the user to modify media for different purposes, as increasing a dataset or just changing some properties.

This library is different to many others in the way that wants to **make image and video transformation simple** by one liners, but fully customisable at the same time. Media transformation for everyone.

<br/>

## 🛠️ Installation

To install the library, read the following lines:

### Pip

```
pip install mediafier
```

To uninstall the library, just execute ```pip uninstall mediafier```

<br/>
<br/>

## 🙏 Our Mantras

* Simple is better than complex
* Less Stack Overflow and more high level programming
* Functions have to be self-explanatory
* As customisable as the user wants through parameters

<br/>
<br/>

## 💡 Features

* This library acts as a wrapper of the most important media transformation libraries nowadays, in order to make media transformation easier to perform.
* Supports both image and video transformation.
* Intended to be focused on media transformation and data augmentation.
* In constant growth, accepts community suggestions, issues and PRs.

## 💻 Code examples

Let's expose some code examples to show how easy it is to perform transformations with this library:

#### Crop an image

```
import cv2
from mediafier.image.cropping import crop


# Load the image with openCV
img = cv2.imread('path/to/image.png')

# Crop the image from the point 100,100 to the point 200,200
finalimg = crop(img, 100, 100, 100, 100)
```

#### Crop an image keeping original size (by adding borders)

```
import cv2
from mediafier.image.cropping import crop

# Load the image with openCV
img = cv2.imread('path/to/image.png')

# Crop the image from the point 100,100 to the point 200,200
finalimg = crop(img, 100, 100, 100, 100, fill=True)
```

#### Resize an image to the 125% of its size

```
import cv2
from mediafier.image.size import resize

# Load the image with openCV
img = cv2.imread('path/to/image.png')

# Resize the image
finalimg = resize(img, ratio=125)
```

#### Resize an image to 1280x720 changing the interpolation to 'area'

```
import cv2
from mediafier.image.size import resize

# Load the image with openCV
img = cv2.imread('path/to/image.png')

# Resize the image
finalimg = resize(img, size=(1280,720), interpolation='area)
```

#### Draw a bounding box on the image

```
import cv2
from mediafier.image.draw import drawBBox

# Load the image with openCV
img = cv2.imread('path/to/image.png')

# Draw a bounding box from the point 100,100 to the 300,300
finalimg = drawBBox(img, 100, 100, 200, 200, color='black', thickness='2')
```
